JN975492.1	CDS_HAS_STOP_CODON	VF1	in-frame stop codon exists 5' of stop position predicted by homology to reference [revised to 5044..5277 (stop shifted 408 nt)]
JN975492.1	CDS_HAS_STOP_CODON	VF1	stop codon in protein-based alignment [stop codon(s) end at position(s) 5277]
JN975492.1	INDEFINITE_ANNOTATION_END	VF1	protein-based alignment does not extend close enough to nucleotide-based alignment 3' endpoint [36 > 5 (strand:+ CM:5685 blastx:5649, no valid stop codon in CM prediction)]
JN975492.1	INDEFINITE_ANNOTATION_START	VP2	protein-based alignment does not extend close enough to nucleotide-based alignment 5' endpoint [54 > 5 (strand:+ CM:6656 blastx:6710)]
