Design goals of reorganization:

1. Split dnaorg_annotate_genomes.pl into dnaorg_build.pl and
   dnaorg_annotate.pl. 
   Reason: dnaorg_build.pl needs to only be run once per species
   (or rather, per update of the reference accession for the species)
   And dnaorg_annotate.pl can be called many times for each species.

2. Remove need for prerequired run of dnaorg_virus_wrapper.pl.

3. Put reusable modular and documented code into a perl module
   (dnaorg.pm).

4. Better error handling. DNAORG_FAIL() function prints informative
   error message to the two main output files (.log and .cmd) before
   closing those files and exiting.

5. Better logging of commands (all commands that are run are now
   output to a .cmd file).

6. Better output informing user of output files created by the
   script. All files with descriptions are now printed.

7. Cleaner code that is more modular, easier to understand by people
   other than me (think summer student or IEBer), and easier to
   maintain.
