Multi-segment CDS tests for N-ends code (ambg{5,3}{c,f,s} alerts).


Two fasta files:
1. entoy100a.nends.fa:
   Sequence names are somewhat descriptive.
   Some of these examples were based on FP-175. See the description of
   that JIRA ticket.

> esl-seqstat -a $VADRSCRIPTSDIR/testfiles/entoy100a.nends.fa
= ENTOY100A-pass                 100 
= ENTOY100A/one-4Ns-start-11-14      100 
= ENTOY100A-one-4Ns-end-28-31      100 
= ENTOY100A-one-4Ns-start-4Ns-end-11-14,28-31      100

= ENTOY100A-one-second-to-final-posn-R-30-pass      100 
= ENTOY100A-one-first-position-N-11      100 
= ENTOY100A-one-final-position-N      100

= ENTOY100A/one-cds-only-stop-len3-29-31      100 

2. entoy100.nends.r.fa: 
   More complicated examples, run with -r, but that's not especially
   important. 

> esl-seqstat -a $VADRSCRIPTSDIR/testfiles/entoy100a.nends.r.fa
= ENTOY100A/pass                 100 
= ENTOY100A/two-cds-all-Ns-but-47-and-48      100 

= ENTOY100A/two-cds-all-Ns-but-47-and-48: this is a 3nt codon only
  because position 47 is duplicated in the CDS, like a frameshift.

See $VADRSCRIPTSDIR/testfiles/entoy100a.genematchcds.minfo for
coordinates of each feature.

TODO: 
- add more complicated examples from cds two and three in entoy100a
- add examples on reverse strand in entoy100a.rev, possibly mirror
  images of the other examples, to test reverse strand.
