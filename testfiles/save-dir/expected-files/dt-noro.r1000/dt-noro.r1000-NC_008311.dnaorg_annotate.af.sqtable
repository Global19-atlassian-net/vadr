Additional note(s) to submitter:
ERROR: Indefinite Annotation at Start: (VP1) blastx protein validation failure, protein alignment does not extend close enough to nucleotide alignment 5' endpoint [VP1: start positions differ by 516 > 5 (strand:+ CM:27 blastx:543)]
ERROR: Indefinite Annotation at Stop: (VF1) blastx protein validation failure, protein alignment does not extend close enough to nucleotide alignment 3' endpoint [VF1: stop positions differ by 414 > 8 (strand:+ CM:681 blastx:267, valid stop codon in CM prediction)]
ERROR: Low Coverage: 0.837<0.900
