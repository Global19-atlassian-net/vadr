# Definitions of non-obvious terms above:
#
# overlap:  two features i and j overlap if they are on both on the same strand and overlap by >= 1 nt.
# adjacent: two features i and j are adjacent if they are on the same strand and
#           start_i < start_j and stop_i+1 == start_j.
#           (Note that on the positive strand start_i <= stop_i for all i,
#           (and that  on the negative strand start_i >= stop_i for all i)
