Additional note(s) to submitter:
ERROR: INDEFINITE_ANNOTATION_END: (ORF1) alignment to homology model has low confidence at 3' boundary [0.60 < 0.80, RF position 5374]
ERROR: INDEFINITE_ANNOTATION_END: (nonstructural polyprotein) alignment to homology model has low confidence at 3' boundary [0.60 < 0.80, RF position 5374]
ERROR: INDEFINITE_ANNOTATION: (nonstructural polyprotein) nucleotide-based search identifies CDS not identified in protein-based search
ERROR: MUTATION_AT_END: (nonstructural polyprotein) expected stop codon could not be identified, predicted CDS stop by homology is invalid [AAA ending at position 15 on + strand is not a valid stop]
ERROR: PEPTIDE_TRANSLATION_PROBLEM: (RdRp) mat_peptide may not be translated because its parent CDS has a problem
