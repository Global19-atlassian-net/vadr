1     mutendcd  yes      MUTATION_AT_END              feature      3     3  expected stop codon could not be identified, predicted CDS stop by homology is invalid
2     mutendns  yes      MUTATION_AT_END              feature      3     3  expected stop codon could not be identified, no in-frame stop codon exists 3' of predicted valid start codon
3     unexleng  yes      UNEXPECTED_LENGTH            feature     29    15  length of complete coding (CDS or mat_peptide) feature is not a multiple of 3
4     cdsstopn  yes      CDS_HAS_STOP_CODON           feature      9     9  in-frame stop codon exists 5' of stop position predicted by homology to reference
5     cdsfshft  yes      POSSIBLE_FRAMESHIFT          feature     28    20  potential frameshift in CDS
6     peptrans  yes      PEPTIDE_TRANSLATION_PROBLEM  feature     16     8  mat_peptide may not be translated because its parent CDS has a problem
7     pepadjcy  yes      PEPTIDE_ADJACENCY_PROBLEM    feature      2     2  predictions of two mat_peptides expected to be adjacent are not adjacent
8     indf5gap  yes      INDEFINITE_ANNOTATION_START  feature      2     2  alignment to homology model is a gap at 5' boundary
9     indf5loc  yes      INDEFINITE_ANNOTATION_START  feature      1     1  alignment to homology model has low confidence at 5' boundary
10    indf3gap  yes      INDEFINITE_ANNOTATION_END    feature      7     5  alignment to homology model is a gap at 3' boundary
11    indf3loc  yes      INDEFINITE_ANNOTATION_END    feature      2     2  alignment to homology model has low confidence at 3' boundary
