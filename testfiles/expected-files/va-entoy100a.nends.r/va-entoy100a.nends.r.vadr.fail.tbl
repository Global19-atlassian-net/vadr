Additional note(s) to submitter:
ERROR: N_AT_CDS_END: (protein two) final nucleotide of CDS is an N [final 24 positions are Ns, final non-N is position 48]
ERROR: N_AT_CDS_START: (protein two) first nucleotide of CDS is an N [first 15 positions are Ns, first non-N is position 47]
ERROR: N_AT_CDS_START: (protein three) first nucleotide of CDS is an N [first 7 positions are Ns, first non-N is position 74]
ERROR: PEPTIDE_TRANSLATION_PROBLEM: (protein three mp1) mat_peptide may not be translated because its parent CDS has a problem
ERROR: PEPTIDE_TRANSLATION_PROBLEM: (protein three mp2) mat_peptide may not be translated because its parent CDS has a problem
