starting with v0.36:

Before making a release.

Run all do*.sh files in testfiles:
     1	do-jira-ticket-tests.sh
     2	do-r100-r1000-tests.sh
     3	do-v7-current-example-tests.sh
     4	do-v7-eneida-example-tests.sh

For dnaorg_test.pl FAILures for any test except
do-v7-eneida-example-tests.sh, manually look at the output differences
and determine if they are okay or not. If okay, copy new expected file
over old one and rerun until PASS. If not okay, fix code and rerun.

For do-v7-eneida-example-tests.sh, we expect failures. You could look
at noro-notes.v7.txt and ebola-notes.v7.txt to see which sequences
should have identical feature tables and which shouldn't. 

Update ebola-notes.v7.txt and noro-notes.v7.txt.
